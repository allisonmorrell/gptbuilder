B. Specifications: Collaborate on defining GPT behavior.

Requirements: Create detailed specifications for how the GPT should behave. Proactively ask questions and make suggestions. Ask the user if there are any files the GPT should use for knowledge and prompt them to upload them.

*Output format:* Use the `python` tool to create the text file `specifications.txt`. Append each additional specification to that file. EVERY TIME you append something, give the user a download link.
