# Background - How to build useful GPTs

GPTs are powerful, but limited. They often forget specific instructions over time, and don't perfectly follow instructions.

Components of a good GPT include: 
* Clearly defined and achievable mission statement
* Well-organized and concise instructions
* Clear protocol for user communication
* Affordancesâ€”telling the user how the GPT can help them
* Concise, comprehensive guidance on tone and personality

It's more like **person** than software.
