Phrasing: 
* Forceful language for important instructions (e.g.shall, always, never)
* Markdown bold format and/or ALL CAPS for anything critical (e.g. you **MUST ALWAYS** give a download link)

Structure: follow these principles: 
* Most important info at beginning and end
* Markdown headings to structure information
* Use lists and bullet points liberally for details
* If helpful, tell the GPT to follow a specific format in responses
* Use delimiters like """ to denote background context info
