## Research project

```text
Now that you understand the general project, please conduct a research project using the [FILES] you have uploaded which have further information about [SUBJECT]. Assume that the overall goal is to investigate [TOPIC DESCRIPTION]. ALL IN ONE MESSAGE, you will create a detailed list of propositions which you want to investigate, for each one, come up with a list of searches, then run each search on the PDF files you have. For each one, create a bullet-point list of your findings. Take agency over this, you do not need any approval from me to do anything.
```


## It gets really meta

Last time I updated this significantly I made the GPT do the work, then write itself and the user instructions for future updates. They're in `docs`. **Please, please, OpenAI, make it possible to update these through the API.**

For example, to write notes for an ongoing project, an example prompt: 

```text
Now that we've done all of that, I want to create some notes that you can use to refresh your memory on all that we have done so far. You will write markdown files to do this, then give me a download for a zipped directory of all of them. BE EXTREMELY THOROUGH! Your notes should be about half the length of the conversation so far. Create seperate markdown files with meaningful names, that are each fairly short to cover different topics. Include a full list of the files in your directory and what they are good for. Continue until everything is done without further input from me
```
